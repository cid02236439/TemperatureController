A simple assembly program for PIC18 microprocessor.

Reads a table (message) from programme memory to data memory.

Initialises UART and writes a message (the table) to UART. 

ACD.s, ADC_Potentiometer.s, ADC_Potentiometer_working.s.s and main_alternatives are redundent files.

main.s contains the main sequence.
